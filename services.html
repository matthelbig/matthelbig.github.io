<h1>Let's work together</h1>

<p><strong>Services we provide:</strong> Assets works hard to make sure that every dollar donated to us is used efficiently, effectively, and transparently. We appreciate the trust our donors place in us, and believe that with that trust comes a responsibility to be completely open about our financials. That's why, every year, our financial statements are thoroughly audited by an outside firm. It's also why we make the results of those audits available to anyone who wishes to see them.</p>

<p>For a combined 43 years, our organization has been committed to providing services and developing strategies focused on preventing and ending homelessness. We connect with 84 human service agencies, share consumer populations, and play an integral role in implementing Chicago’s Plan to End Homelessness.</p>

<p>In an effort to truly realize our common vision – a home for everyone, including the most vulnerable and the most challenged – we have decided to join our teams to create a single and effective service system and advocacy force to solve the homelessness crisis in Chicago.</p>

<p>This partnership allows us to provide a more holistic approach to preventing and ending homelessness in Chicago and increase the amount of housing available to Chicago’s most vulnerable. </p>  

<p>While each organization is retaining its identity and non-profit status, the Chicago Alliance to End Homelessness and the Emergency fund have combined our leadership, efforts and resources in order to deepen our impact. Together, we strive to ensure that everyone in our community has the stability of home and no one is left behind. We look forward to working with you to carry out this important mission.</p>
