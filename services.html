<h1>Let's work together</h1>

<p>The Emergency Fund works hard to make sure that every dollar donated to us is used efficiently, effectively, and transparently. We appreciate the trust our donors place in us, and believe that with that trust comes a responsibility to be completely open about our financials. That's why, every year, our financial statements are thoroughly audited by an outside firm. It's also why we make the results of those audits available to anyone who wishes to see them.</p>

<p>Chicago now has a strong, united voice and effective resource to prevent and end homelessness.</p>

<p>Effective October 1, 2011 the Chicago Alliance to End Homelessness and the Emergency Fund combined their work, offices and energies in the fight against homelessness, creating a single, seamless system for delivering housing assistance and services to the city of Chicago.</p>

<p>For a combined 43 years, our organizations have been committed to providing services and developing strategies focused on preventing and ending homelessness. Together, we connect with 84 human service agencies, share consumer populations, and play an integral role in implementing Chicago’s Plan to End Homelessness.</p>

<p>In an effort to truly realize our common vision – a home for everyone, including the most vulnerable and the most challenged – we have decided to join our teams to create a single and effective service system and advocacy force to solve the homelessness crisis in Chicago.</p>

<p>This partnership allows us to provide a more holistic approach to preventing and ending homelessness in Chicago and increase the amount of housing available to Chicago’s most vulnerable. </p>  

<p>CEO Nonie Brennan, longtime champion for the underserved, leads this consolidated-entity along with a dedicated and valued team of 23 board members and 14 staff members. </p>

<p>While each organization is retaining its identity and non-profit status, the Chicago Alliance to End Homelessness and the Emergency fund have combined our leadership, efforts and resources in order to deepen our impact. Together, we strive to ensure that everyone in our community has the stability of home and no one is left behind. We look forward to working with you to carry out this important mission.</p>

	<p>Greater Chicagoland we need you. People should consider the value of a long-term investment in something. Can you make your idea your life's work instead of your life's work being 30 ideas? Or, can you find that one thing that ends up being your life's work instead of searching out these short moments of excitement?</p>
